                            10 years from now, Iâ€™d hope I graduated from a university. Years prior to this, I would have
                            been interning for NASA or any other space travel related company. Hopefully, during this
                            time
                            I would've had the opportunity to practiced on my networking skills and got a few sponsors
                            to help start up my
                            own company. I also want to be able to support myself. How I would do this is by saving a
                            certain amount of money for when I actually attempt to get my company started up. Since my
                            company would barely be starting up, we could focus more on research and building/designing
                            small spacecrafts. Through all of this and the help of my amazing future team,
                            I would hope to have started a project directed towards a discovery. Possibly
                            regarding parallel universes or even a new planet.

                            A person I look up to is Didier Queloz. He won a Nobel Prize for his extensive research on
                            exoplanets
                            and discovery of the planet Altas. He was only 28 years old when he won the award. I hope to
                            be like him if not better. <br>
                            Regarding my health, I want to start a foundation regarding Graves Disease or for thyroid
                            diseases in general. I was diagnosed with Graves at 6 years old and have struggled a lot
                            with health because of it. Despite it being around for more than a century, we know almost
                            nothing about it. I want to start the change. We need to bring more recognization towards
                            autoimmune diseases like Graves.
