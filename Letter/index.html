                <p>To my 8th grade self, <br>

                    Don’t give up. I know it’s hard right now with everything going on regarding your health. I know you
                    don’t think you’re smart or have any chance of being successful even though that’s far from true. I
                    promise it gets better. What you have yet to realize is that your GPA doesn’t determine whether or
                    not you can make it in this world. That being said, stop focusing on it. Whatever school we graduate
                    from, we will become successful after. A lot of people fail to realize you don’t have to go to the
                    most well known school in order to guarantee succession. Whatever school anyone graduates from
                    doesn’t automatically allow them to be successful. It’s the determination and passion you have
                    towards your field that allows succession to take place. You are capable of anything you put your
                    mind to. I have literally seen it first hand. <br>
                    Putting academics aside, you need to take care of yourself, your health. Our disease isn’t going
                    anywhere so we need to stop treating it like it will. You need to learn how to put yourself before
                    anything and anyone. You need to learn to be patient with your health. It’s okay to be sicker some
                    days than others. It’s okay to take days off for your physical and mental health. It’s okay if plans
                    get slowed down because you feel dizzy or tired. It’s NOT okay to push yourself, testing your
                    limits. The only person responsible for ones health is themselves. <br>

                    With much love,<br>
                    Your 12th grade self
                </p>
